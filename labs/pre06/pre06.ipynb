    "By convention, we often compare the proportion we just calculated to 0.05. If the proportion of simulated statistics greater than or equal to the observed statistic is sufficiently small (less than or equal to 0.05), then this is evidence against Emily's model. Otherwise, we donâ€™t have any reason to doubt Emilyâ€™s model. \n",

    "Therapeutic touch fell out of use after this experiment, which was eventually accepted into one of the premier medical journals. TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!\n",

    "1. Is the data more consistent with Emily' model (practioners were randomly guessing)?\n",
    "2. What does this mean in terms of Emily's experiment? Do the TT practitioners' answers follow an even chance model or is there something else at play? "
